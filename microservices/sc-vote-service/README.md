# Service Craze Vote (SC Vote)

This is a demo voting service designed to demonstrate the following concepts:

* Voting on the web
* Microservices using Wildfly-Swarm
* RWD UI using Angular 4 and Bootstrap
* Deployment to Kubernetes

## Caveats

This depends on JoshuaBranch Application Security (JB-AS), the authentication and authorization service used by ServiceCraze that is not currently ready for Kubernetes.  The plan is for a future version of SC Vote to be released that can use an Internet accessible release of JB-AS.
